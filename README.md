## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Vehicle_weight, AWD, and spoiler angle provide a non random amount of variance. The maximum random variance was provided by ground_clearence and vehicle_length.
* The slope is not equal to zero because the p-value is less than zero.

* Using the model our answers will be correct about 71.5% of the time because the R squared value is .7149.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The Total Summary table is looking at PSI statistics across all lots where as the Lots Summaries show statistcs of each lot. As seen, Lot 1 and 2, are very similar while Lot 3 has a smaller mean with a bigger variance and standard deviation (SD).
